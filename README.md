This repository contains code for a simulator that runs in the rospy environment. It is a simulation for a drone that can plan trajectories through maps, avoid obstacles, has a PID controller, and also be manually controlled with your keyboard!

Instructions on setting up your environment, installing dependencies and running the code coming soon.

Special thanks to @elbaum @hildebrandt-carl @ananevans for creating the framework and simulator.
